# Rishika Randev's MiniProject 9 (Cloud Hosted Notebook) for IDS706

Google Colab notebook link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ByaP5fCPyhD2DOwKdj8APDBREQIadSIz?usp=sharing

## ☑️ Requirements:
1. Set up a cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebook (e.g., Google Colab)
2. Perform data manipulation tasks on a sample dataset

## ☑️ The Dataset
The first dataset used in this project shows the frequency of depression and anxiety symptoms for various different groups across the US over the course of 7 days (05/07 - 05/14) in 2020. It was collected by the U.S. Census Bureau as part of the Household Pulse Survey to capture the impact of COVID on Americans, and is freely available through data.gov at this link: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/indicators-of-anxiety-or-depression-based-on-reported-frequency-of-symptoms-during-last-7-.

The second dataset in this project is a mapping of each US state to a regional division and region, and was taken from here: https://github.com/cphalpert/census-regions

## ☑️ Steps
1. Prepare the necesary configuration files like the Dockerfile, devcontainer.json, Makefile, requirements.txt, and main.yml for GitHub Actions integration. Ensure that the requirements.txt lists all necessary packages.
2. Navigate to Google Colab and create a new Jupyter notebook called main.ipynb. This is where all of your data ingestion, exploration, and manipulation code will go. Please reference this video for a walkthrough of what is included in this notebook.
3. Include basic tests of the main script in the test_main.py file to ensure that its functionalities are working as expected.
